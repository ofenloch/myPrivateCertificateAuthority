# Setting Up My Own Certificate Authority (CA)

## General Remarks

There is a lot of information, howtos, readmes, manpages, tutorials etc. on the net. For me, it's mostly confusing. Also, I never seem to be able to keep all that stuff in mind because I rarely use it.

So, I started this project to gather some information. For educational reasons I've decided to create my own CA. Here is what I learned. Further I wanted to have a tool to manage my own CA and create some certificates with it.

A very useful (though a bit outdated) document is [Igor Soarez](https://gist.github.com/soarez)'s  [collection of thoughts and insights](https://gist.github.com/soarez/9688998) on GitHub.

[Camilo Flores](https://github.com/llekn) shares a [set of shell scripts to manage a private CA](https://github.com/llekn/openssl-ca).

And of course a look at [the man pages](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/) never hurts.
