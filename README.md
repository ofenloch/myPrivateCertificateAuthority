# Setting Up My Own CA (Certification Authority)

## General Remarks

There is a lot of information, howto, readme, manpage, tutorial etc. in the net. For me, it's mostly confusing.

So, I started this project to gather some information. For educational reasons I've decided to create my own CA. Here is what I learned. Further I wanted to have a tool to manage my own CA and create some certificates with it.

One useful document is [soarez/ca.md](https://gist.github.com/soarez/9688998) on GitHub.

And of course a look at [the man pages](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/) never hurts.
